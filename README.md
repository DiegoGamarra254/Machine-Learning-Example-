# Machine-Learning-Example-scikit-learn
**This is a Machine Learning example using scikit-learn.** 
In this example we will train a ML model for prediction of real state prices. We will do a supervised regression and the metric will be mean squared error and we will be following this steps:
 ## 1. Divide the data set into train and test
 ## 2. EDA
 ## 3. Impute values, encode categorical data, normalize and add calculated fields.
 ## 4. Pipeline.
       In this step we will put the tasks of the previous step in a single pipeline using a function
 ## 5. Model training.  
       We will choose between Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor

 ## 6. Model adjust
       In this step we will find the best hyperparameters for the model
 ## 7. Model testing
       Once the model has been adjusted we will calculate the final RMSE
 ## 8. Deployment
