# Machine-Learning-Example-scikit-learn
**This is a Machine Learning example using scikit-learn.** 

In this example we will train a ML model for prediction of real state prices. We will do a supervised regression and the metric will be mean squared error and we will be following this steps:
1. Divide the data set into train and test
2. EDA

4. Impute values, encode categorical data, normalize and add calculated fields.
5. Pipeline. In this step we will put the tasks of the previous step in a single pipeline using a function
6. Model training.  We will choose between Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor

7. Model adjust. In this step we will find the best hyperparameters for the model
8. Model testing. Once the model has been adjusted we will calculate the final RMSE
9. Deployment
